	<td><p><h3>Engineering is not only study of 45 subjects but it is moral studies of intellectual life.”
	      “Engineers like to solve problems. If there are no problems handily available, they will create their own problems."
	  “There’s nothing I believe in more strongly than getting young people interested in science and engineering, for a better tomorrow, for all humankind.”
	  “Engineering is the art of modelling materials we do not wholly understand, into shapes we cannot precisely analyse so as to withstand forces we cannot properly assess, in such a way that the public has no reason to suspect the extent of our ignorance.”

	<h3><p align="justify">we the college of srinivas college of engineering is accretiated with NAAC A++ GRADE and also accrediated with NBA A+ grade 
		we are affiliated to BHASHITH ALI OF TECHNOLOGY AND ENGINEERING.we also provide some industrial results
		Established by the renowned BAT (1967) in the year 1985, the College drew its initial impetus from people's representatives, local doctors, charitable trusts and commercial houses of VIJAYAWAD District.

Today, it enjoys flagship status among the eight constituent institutions that are governed by .The founder-members of BATE and their successors have provided abundant inputs to turn a mere 3 programmes -180-intake College into a 16 programmes -1428 - intake by the 2020. The premier status of the institution is made possible by sticking to our core-principles of student-focus, Human Resource Development and emphasis on total quality.

To its credit, the institution has been accredited 6 times for all eligible courses by the National Board of Accreditation, AICTE in 1998, 2002, 2007, 2012, 2017, & 2021 and had also received NAAC - A+ Grade in 2021. The institute is under NIRF rank band 201 - 250(for 2020) and ISO 9001:2015 certification from 2019. The institute's past efforts in academic performances, and the capability of self governance won the status of autonomy in 2012, and this status of autonomy made it more responsible and ambitious.

Conferment of Rastrapati Award-Indira Gandhi NSS Award in 2014, adjudgement as the second best rated college in the 'academic audit and grading' in 2004 by the A.P. State Council of Higher Education (YTRUY),awarding as the best performing U.G. College in the university examinations, continuously for three years, and a place among the `top-100 engineering colleges in the country, are just a few examples not to boast about the college but to narrate with modesty, the successful path, it is treading on.

Once again, humbly to state, the college is not content with what it accomplished in the form of awards and rewards but is continuously striving to provide holistic education to the engineering aspirants.
